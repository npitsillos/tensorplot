# Tensorplot
A visualisation tool to automate the process of grabbing tensorboard events
data and visualising them.  This allows for faster result analysis in my work.

## Features
* Upload experiments logged with PyTorch's SummaryWriter to tensorboard.dev and creates a log of uploaded experiments.
* 

## Notes
This is still in its early stages so if a problem arises don't forget to create an issue!

## Contributing
If anyone wants to contribute in any way then feel free to open a PR or an issue and we can discuss it.

## Benefits
1. Faster result analysis
2. Less code writting
3. Separate experiments from analysis
4. Allows for more research tim
